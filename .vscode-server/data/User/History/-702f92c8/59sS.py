Step 5: Get input from four buttons connected to GPIO

Once the one_button.py routine is working, expand the routine to include all 4 buttons. This routine (called ‘four_buttons.py’) should

• Be based on one_button.py

• Extend the function to include checks for all 4 buttons being pressed by printing the message ‘Button NN has been pressed’ where NN is the pin number of the appropriate button.

• For one of the buttons on the ‘edge’ of the screen, print out ‘Button NN has been pressed’ and also quit the python program.
